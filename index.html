        Even more stuff can go in here <!-- using spaces or enters will not lead to more paragraph breaks-->
        You can break lines by using the following 
        <br /><br />  <!-- will be only b instead or br in HTML5-->

        <b> this is going to be bold</b>
        <i> this is going to be italic</i>
        <u> this is going to be underlined</u>
        <em> this is going to be emphasized or italics </em>
        <strong> this is going to be like in bold tags </strong>
