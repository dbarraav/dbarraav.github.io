I had seen a lot of graduate students have their own websites to display their research 
interests, projects, publications, among other information. I thought I would start this 
website to also document my own journey throughout graduate school. I will be entering a PhD
program in August 2021. I hope to continue to update this site to showcase my skill development 
and I might possibly start a blog as well.
